Configuring DDNS using bind9
Here, changeDNS.py takes the data from data.json which should be in the same folder and parses json and updates the information to Bind9 DNS server dynamically using the command nsupdate!
also, here we are using a key which is generated by DNSSEC-KEYGEN.

Command:
dnssec-keygen -a RSASHA256 -n ZONE service.com

this script is specificallyt designed for service.com domain but it is also possible to create for other domains also dynamically but we need to use the proper key for the same!

# Bind9
I bind9 there are 2 important fiels which are named.conf.local in /etc/bind(ubuntu) and db.example.com /var/cache/bind
as you can see named.conf.local has the key and zone where as the db.example.com has A/CNAME etc for the domain...mainly the domain details.
